## Product Philosophy

### Key Principles

**1. Async-first design**
- No real-time coordination required
- Rich context on every task
- Updates work across timezones
- Comments replace meetings

**2. Context over status**
- Every task answers: What? Why? Who? When? How?
- No cryptic task titles
- Full background always attached
- Reduces whats this about? questions

**3. Speed matters**
- Sub-second page loads
- Keyboard shortcuts everywhere
- No loading spinners
- Instant search

**4. Opinionated with escape hatches**
- Strong defaults (workflows that work)
- Flexibility when needed
- Not overwhelming with options

**5. Beautiful and functional**
- Design quality matters
- UI guides users to success
- Delightful micro-interactions


## Core Features

### 1. Task Management

**What users can do:**
- Create tasks with rich descriptions (markdown support)
- Assign to team members
- Set due dates, priorities, tags
- Add attachments, links, context
- Subtasks for complex work
- Custom fields (text, number, select, date)

**Our differentiation:**
- **Context cards:** Every task has built-in space for context (why, background, decisions)
- **Rich descriptions:** Full markdown, embeds, code blocks
- **Smart defaults:** Priority, owner, due date auto-suggested based on patterns

### 2. Projects & Organization

**What users can do:**
- Create projects (collections of tasks)
- Multiple views: List, Board (Kanban), Calendar, Timeline (Gantt)
- Filter and sort tasks
- Saved views (custom filters)
- Project templates

**Our differentiation:**
- **View memory:** Tool remembers your preferred view per project
- **Smart filters:** Natural language (My tasks due this week)
- **Project status:** Auto-calculated based on task completion

### 3. Collaboration

**What users can do:**
- Comment on tasks (threaded discussions)
- @mention team members
- React with emojis
- Subscribe to task updates
- Activity feed (whats happening)

**Our differentiation:**
- **Comment summaries:** AI-generated summary of long threads
- **Decision tracking:** Mark comments as Decision (findable later)
- **Context preservation:** Every update includes full context

### 4. Notifications

**What users can do:**
- Email, in-app, Slack, mobile notifications
- Granular preferences (what to get notified about)
- Digest mode (batched notifications)
- Snooze notifications

**Our differentiation:**
- **Smart batching:** Multiple updates → one notification
- **Contextual notifications:** Includes enough context to act without clicking
- **Timezone aware:** Notifications only during work hours

### 5. Integrations

**What users can do:**
- **Slack:** Post updates, create tasks, get notifications
- **GitHub:** Link PRs to tasks, auto-update status
- **Figma:** Embed designs, link to tasks
- **Google Drive:** Attach docs, preview in-app
- **Calendar:** Sync due dates (Google Cal, Outlook)

**Our differentiation:**
- **Two-way sync:** Changes in TaskFlow update connected tools
- **Context flow:** Integrations pull in context automatically

### 6. Reporting & Analytics

**What users can do:**
- Team velocity (tasks completed over time)
- Cycle time (time to complete)
- Burndown charts
- Custom reports (filter by anything)
- Export to CSV

**Our differentiation:**
- **Automatic insights:** Team velocity decreased 20% - investigate
- **Predictive analytics:** At current pace, project will finish 3 days late

## Product Metrics

### North Star Metric

**Weekly Active Teams** - Teams that complete at least one task per week

- Indicates real usage (not just logins)
- Measures team collaboration (not individual)
- Leading indicator of retention
- Correlates with revenue

**Current:** 850 weekly active teams
**Goal (Q1 2025):** 1,200 weekly active teams


### Product Health Metrics

**Activation:**
- **Definition:** User completes first task within 7 days of signup
- **Current:** 45%
- **Target:** 60%
- **Why it matters:** Activated users are 5x more likely to become paying customers

**Retention:**
- **Definition:** % of users active in month N who are active in month N+1
- **Current:** 65%
- **Target:** 75%
- **Why it matters:** Retention drives LTV (lifetime value)

**Time to Value:**
- **Definition:** Time from signup to first task completed
- **Current:** 45 minutes (median)
- **Target:** 15 minutes
- **Why it matters:** Faster value = higher activation

**Viral Coefficient:**
- **Definition:** Average invites sent per user × invite acceptance rate
- **Current:** 1.2 (barely viral)
- **Target:** 1.5+ (truly viral)
- **Why it matters:** Viral growth reduces CAC (customer acquisition cost)
