## 1.6: 项目记忆

 - **完成时间：** 20-25 分钟
 - **先修要求：** 完成模块 1.1-1.5


> **在 Claude Code 中启动这个模块：** 运行 `/start-1-6` 来开始互动体验。

## 📖 概述

CLAUDE.md 是 Claude 为你的项目提供的永久记忆。写一次，Claude 就会在每次对话中知道你的产品上下文 - 无需重新解释。

**关键要点：** CLAUDE.md 是你项目的宪法 - 不可变的规则，覆盖临时提示。虽然提示是灵活的请求，但 CLAUDE.md 建立了你项目的最高法则。


## 🏛️ What Is CLAUDE.md?

### The Core Concept

CLAUDE.md is a markdown file in your project directory containing permanent context about your product, team, and preferences. Claude automatically reads it at session start and applies everything in it.

**Three key properties:**
- **Automatic loading:** Claude reads it at session start automatically
- **Persistent memory:** Carries across ALL conversations in that directory
- **Team-shareable:** Commit to git, entire team gets same context

### The Constitution vs Legislation Hierarchy

Understanding this hierarchy is crucial:

| Aspect | CLAUDE.md (Constitution) | User Prompts (Legislation) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Priority** | Supreme - always wins | Secondary - must comply |
| **Permanence** | Stays forever | Temporary per request |
| **Scope** | Applies to all sessions | Applies to current task |
| **Purpose** | Immutable project rules | Flexible specific requests |
| **Example** | Always call it Workspace | Create a PRD for dark mode |

**If there's a conflict, CLAUDE.md ALWAYS wins.**

### Example: Terminology Override

**CLAUDE.md says:**
```markdown
Always use Workspace not Project in TaskFlow documentation.
```

**You prompt:**
```
Write a PRD for the new Project dashboard feature
```

**Claude does:**
```
Writes the PRD using "Workspace dashboard" because CLAUDE.md overrides
your casual prompt wording
```


## # The Power of the # Symbol

### Dynamic Session Rules

Add temporary rules to your current session using **#** at the start of a line:

```
# Always use bullet points instead of numbered lists in this session
```

Claude treats this as a rule for the rest of your conversation (but not future sessions).

### # vs CLAUDE.md

| Feature | # Symbol | CLAUDE.md |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Duration** | Current session only | Forever |
| **Scope** | This conversation | All conversations |
| **Use case** | Experimenting with preferences | Permanent project rules |

**Workflow:** Use # to experiment, then add to CLAUDE.md when you want it permanent.


## 📝 What to Put in CLAUDE.md

### ✅ GOOD for CLAUDE.md

**1. Product Context**
```markdown
## Product Overview

TaskFlow is a project management SaaS for remote-first teams.
Think Asana meets Jira, built for async collaboration.

Stage: Series B ($20M raised, 50 employees)
Revenue: $2.5M ARR, 10,000 active users
```

**2. User Personas**
```markdown
## User Personas

### Sarah - Enterprise Admin
- Role: IT Administrator at 500+ person company
- Pain points: Needs SSO, audit logs, compliance, security
- Quote: "I need to prove this meets our security standards"
```

**3. Writing Style**
```markdown
## Writing Style

- Use active voice (not passive)
- Use Oxford commas in all lists
- Maximum 2-sentence paragraphs for readability
- Use "we" not "I" in documentation
```

**4. Product Terminology**
```markdown
## Product Terminology

ALWAYS use these terms (NEVER use alternatives):
- Workspace not Project - Our top-level container
- Task not Todo or Issue - Individual work items
- PM means Product Manager (not Project Manager)
```

**5. Immutable Rules**
```markdown
## Immutable Rules

These rules override any prompt that conflicts:

1. ALWAYS include acceptance criteria in user stories
   - Use Given/When/Then format
   - Make them specific and testable

2. NEVER write PRDs without user research references
```

### ❌ DON'T Put in CLAUDE.md

**1. Temporary Instructions**
```markdown
Today's meeting notes are in meeting-2025-10-13.txt
We're working on dark mode this sprint
```
*Why bad:* These change constantly. Use prompts instead.

**2. Frequently Changing Requirements**
```markdown
Current sprint goal: Implement SSO
Q4 OKR: Increase activation to 55%
```
*Why bad:* If it changes weekly or monthly, it doesn't belong.

**3. Sensitive Information**
```markdown
Our revenue is actually declining (don't tell the board)
API keys: sk-proj-xxxxx
```
*Why bad:* CLAUDE.md is often committed to git and shared.

### The Test

**If you'd want Claude to know this in 6 months, put it in CLAUDE.md.**

**If it might change next week, use prompts instead.**


## 🏗️ CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

### Four Levels

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md              # 1. Global (all your projects)
/project-root/CLAUDE.md          # 2. Project-specific
/project-root/frontend/CLAUDE.md # 3. Directory-specific
/project-root/CLAUDE.local.md    # 4. Personal (gitignored)
```

### Priority Order

**Most specific wins:**

1. **Directory-level** (e.g., `/frontend/CLAUDE.md`)
2. **Project-level** (e.g., `/project-root/CLAUDE.md`)
3. **Global** (e.g., `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
4. **User prompts** (least priority)

**How they stack:** Levels combine (don't replace). All rules apply simultaneously, with more specific levels overriding on conflicts.

### When to Use Each Level

| Level | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Global** | Personal preferences across all work | "I prefer brief summaries, max 3 bullets" |
| **Project** | Product-specific context everyone needs | Product overview, personas, terminology |
| **Directory** | Rules for subsection of project | Frontend: mobile responsiveness, Backend: API docs |
| **Personal** | Your preferences you don't want to share | Personal response format preferences |

**Important:** Add `CLAUDE.local.md` to `.gitignore`:
```
# .gitignore
CLAUDE.local.md
```

## 💡 Best Practices

**Be Specific, Not Vague:**
- ❌ "Users like simple interfaces"
- ✅ "User research (8/10 interviews, June 2025) showed users abandon features with more than 3 required fields. Keep forms minimal."

**Use Imperative Language:**
- ❌ "It would be nice if user stories had acceptance criteria"
- ✅ "ALWAYS include acceptance criteria in user stories"

**Provide Context:**
- ❌ "Use Workspace not Project"
- ✅ "Use Workspace not Project - We differentiate from traditional project management tools. Workspace signals collaboration space."

**Keep It Scannable:**
- Use bullet points liberally
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Bold key terms
- Add spacing between sections

**Maintain Regularly:**
- Review quarterly (personas, terminology, metrics)
- Commit to git and review changes in PRs
- Keep it current (aim for 50-200 lines sweet spot)


## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Rules being ignored?**
- Check for conflicting rules across hierarchy levels
- Make rules explicit: use ALWAYS/NEVER
- Be specific, not vague

**CLAUDE.md not loading?**
- Verify file exists: `ls CLAUDE.md`
- Must be named exactly `CLAUDE.md` (case-sensitive)
- Check file permissions: `ls -la CLAUDE.md`
- Test: Ask "What does my CLAUDE.md say?"

**Too many CLAUDE.md files?**
- Audit all: `find . -name CLAUDE.md`
- Document hierarchy in README
- Use CLAUDE.local.md for personal preferences

**CLAUDE.md too long?**
- Aim for 50-200 lines
- Move detailed context to separate reference docs
- Link to those docs from CLAUDE.md
